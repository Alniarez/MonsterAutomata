# MonsterAutomata

A "Cellular automata" made in java during my lunch break.

Things:
  - Creatures have a randomized gender, unique names, a lifespan and age
  - If age > lifespan then creature dies :(
  - Creatures move to random free adjacent positions on each iteration
  - Creatures fight with other creatures of the same gender if they try to move to a position already in use
  - Creatures try to reproduce with other creatures of diferent gender if they try to move to a position already in use
  - A creature with an egg/spawn upon death is replaced by their child
  - There is a randomized mutation
